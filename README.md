# Data Portfolio - Mathias D'souza
Summary of work related to data science and analytics

## [Project 1: Master's Thesis](https://github.com/ds-mathias/thesis)

This project was sponsored industrially by ABSL-EnergySys. The aim of the project was to perform shape optimisation of ABSL's Li-Ion satellite battery structure through combining data science and engineering methods. This project report (click header link to view) has the following report structure:
- Chapter 1: Introduction and motivation
- Chapter 2: Literature review of metamodelling and optimisation techniques
- Chapter 3: Engineering analysis software used
- Chapter 4: Principal component analysis
- Chapter 5: RBF neural network and optimisation
- Chapter 6: Baseline battery optimisation
- Chapter 7: Conclusions

Grade Achieved: 1st Class (81%)

Awards: IMechE Best Project Certificate


## [Project 2: Data Analysis with Python](https://github.com/ds-mathias/IBM-data-analysis-with-python)
Through this IBM certificated course I enhanced my skills with Python for data wrangling, exploratory data analytics, model development and model evaluation. During the project (click header to view) I applied:
- Pandas, Numpy and Scipy libraries to load, manipulate, analyse and visualise large datasets for housing data
- Machine learning regression algorithms using the scikit-learn library to predict housing data
