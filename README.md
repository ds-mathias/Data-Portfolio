[Project 1: Master's Thesis](https://github.com/ds-mathias/thesis)

Shape Optimisation of a Li-Ion Satellite Battery Structure and Mass-Spring-Damper (Industrially sponsored by ABSL-EnerySys):
- Chapter 1: Introduction
- Chapter 2: Literature Review
- Chapter 3: Abaqus and iSight Setup (Engineering Analysis Software)
- Chapter 4: Principal Component Analysis
- Chapter 5: Detailed DOE and Optimisation (RBF Neural Network and Optimisation)

Project 2: Data Analytics with Python
Through this course I enhanced my skills with Python for data wrangling, exploratory data analytics, model development and model evaluation. I applied:
- Pandas, Numpy and Scipy libraries to load, manipulate, analyse and visualise large datasets for housing data
- Machine learning regression algorithms using the scikit-learn library to predict housing data
